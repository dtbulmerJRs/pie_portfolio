pie_portfolio
=============
goal is to make the perfect portfolio website webscripter ever!  

What is here so far:
1. davidnuon.com as seen on github, which is the guide I have been following so far
2. pie-portfolio, which is my own site on dbulmerjrs.co.nr
3. prototype project pie, which was an earlier attempt to do this kind of project
4. Our work will be separted into own folders please
5. Once I(Derrik B) approve of changes, it will go into combined folder
6. Some various examples of good static webscript generators in example static web gens folder

Goals:
1. Showcase work done in all kinds of forms however one wants it, with simple templates:
	-code
	-research papers
	-art or graphic design
	-music or sound design
	-videos
	-other sites
2. Be able to "sale" or barter the use of these scripts and codes to others seeking to make their own portfolio sites, by using the Project PIE Portfolio Webscripts, or in otherwords, freelance with these tools.
3. Make Project PIE into a competitor for equivelent static site generators, such as Jinja2.
4. Add dynamic website engine capability to Project PIE and thus make a competitor to CMS management scripters like Django.

Todo:
-changelog feature
-sqlite3 database feature
-code viewer on article page
-pdf viewer on article page
-word viewer on article page
-support multiple blog posts on a single blog page that operates from its template file
